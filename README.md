# Electron-Positron-pair-production-by-Muon-Nucleus-scattering

This repository intends to hold the files referenced on my final work to obtain my grade on physics. 

It contains two folders, each related with the appendix mention on the work.

Each folder have a README file with the proper information to compile or cite some of the content.

For windows compilation remember to reduce the long of folder name in order to prevent CMake errors.
