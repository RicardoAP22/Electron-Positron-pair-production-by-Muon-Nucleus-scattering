This code is for testing G4RiGeMuPairProductionModel and G4RiGeAngularGenerator.

To compile, make a folder named build and inside write "Cmake .." on your terminal. Then "make" . Finally run the executable MuonE.

For windows, insert CmakeList.txt on CMAKE and then compile with Visual Studio. Open the executable.

This test its for a GEANT4 class.
